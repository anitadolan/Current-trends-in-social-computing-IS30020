What is the most important to social networks analysis is the position or location in relation to others in order to collect data for reaserch purposes. (Hansen, , 2011) Nodes represent not just people but institutions, states and countries (Hansen et al, 2011) Although not entirelly necessary for data analysis, they can give an insight as to how many posts a person makes or how long they have been on that particlar social networking site (Hansen et al, 2011) In networking sites this can be quite useful to obtain information such as geographical location and sex.

Edges show the connection between the nodes. Who is connected to who or how many ties one has with another. There are two kind of edges, directed and undirected. Directed edges show clear origion between two users on a graph. They have clear origion and are shown as a line with arrows betweem directed at the sender and recieptint. An undirected edge has to be recipteded between the nodes. For example, in order to be friends on facebook a user would have to accept or send a facebook request. An undirected age is shown bewteen the nodes with no arrows (Hansen , et al, 2011)

Now it is possible to identify who is connected to whom, and how many bridges were formed in the process and who would be the most influential in the community. Given that social media is part of every day life, it can influence users in their daily lives. One could be influenced to like a page given that another actor has recommended. It has been suggested that your weight can change according to your facebook friends weight (Lectures, 2014). Whats most important for reaserch or marketing  is measuring the degrees as to who connects. Degree centrality measures the number of edges a node has. For example,a facebook graph can show not only who is connected to who but also friends of friends. Using a 1 degree shows the relationship between the nodes however, and 1.5 degree can show which friends know each other. A 2 degree run can show friends of friends that may not be connected to the central node (Hansen, et al, 2011).

Betweeness identifies how nodes are connected to each other. For example, in my graph, if Nuria Giros wanted to contact Denise Harrington she would have to go through Erika Vandenberg who is the most connected on the graph. There is no other actor between them. Closeness can identify the shortest path that one can take to influence a group. Again using my graph, the node that this would apply to would be Erika Vandenberg, also Rob harrington and Mari Carney.  Eigenvector centrality allows one to see how many friends your friemds have. It is a measurment that calculates the degress of nodes that you are connected to (Hansen et al, 2011)

The process for making the Graph.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As instructed, Netviss for facebook was opened. The data was then gathered and a gdf file was created. Downloading and installing the programme Gephi was also required.  By clicking on new project my facebook network was imported. By going to layout and choosing force atlas communities were created. Zooming in allowed for better viewing and selecting the T labelled the nodes and now you could seen the names of my friends.

Selecting partitioning, then modularity was the next step in order to colour code the nodes and communitites. By hitting run and refresh you then had the option to select modularity class and apply. To see who knew who, you go to rank parimater and hit the diamond symbol. Selecting indegree allows you to change the size of the nodes.

If you wanted to take out a certain node or community you go to filters on the right hand side of the page and select typology then select degree range, in or out degree are the options. Selecting in degree at the 1 value filtered out nodes that knew less than 7 friends. The filter options also allowed to filter nodes by sex or geographical location. The was tested but not used for the purpose of the graph. Futher filtering mechanisms were used. In order to clean up the graph you could also right click and delete certain nodes that were of no value or simply just too big of a community to show in the graph. However, it was important to make sure nodes of high connectedness were not deleted. Finally Gephi allows you to export your finished graph as a pdf file.
